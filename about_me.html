    Welcome to my photography page everyone!
    </p>
    <p>
    I'm currently a sophomore at UCLA, majoring in aerospace engineering. I took a digital photography class in senior year of high school, and that was the start of my journey as a photo enthusiast. As you can tell, I pretty much like all kinds of photography!
    </p>
    <p>
    I'm an active member of the Photography Club at UCLA, and I have been working as a photographer for UCLA Community Programs Office since fall 2013. I've learned SO MUCH from my friends in the club and my job. Thanks to everyone who helped me along the way!

    Thanks for the picture, Johnny!
